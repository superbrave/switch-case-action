# switch-case-action

Easily return one of many values based on many conditionals.

## conditionals-with-values

New lines are required between conditionals, what needs to occur for this switch case to work is for the word "true" to occur, then any amount of white space (or none) an arrow (=>) then any amount of whitespace. It will return all remaining text on that line.

## Usage

```yml
      - uses: superbrave/switch-case-action@v1
        id: switch-case
        with:
          default: "its the default"
          conditionals-with-values: |
            ${{ 'test' == 'not-test' }} => shouldnt be this one
            ${{ 'test' == 'test' }} => correctAnswer
          
      - run: echo ${{ steps.switch-case.outputs.value }} # correctAnswer
```
